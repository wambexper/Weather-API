Developed By Peter Wambedde
The Weather Application is a web-based tool that allows users to fetch real-time weather data based on their current location. The application consists of two main pages: index.html and weather.html. Users can click the "Fetch Data" button on the index page to navigate to the weather page, where detailed weather information is displayed.

Getting Started

To run the Weather Application, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. Click the "Fetch Data" button to navigate to the weather.html page, where you can view your current location, a map, and detailed weather information. Usage


API Integration

The Weather Application integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to provide accurate and up-to-date weather information. Replace the API key in the apiKey variable with your own OpenWeatherMap API key for proper functionality. Responsive Design

The application incorporates media queries in the style.css file to ensure a responsive layout on different devices. The design adjusts dynamically to various screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience. Contributing
